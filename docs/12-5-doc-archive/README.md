# 12-5 Archive - Root Directory Markdown Files

This directory contains all markdown files that were previously in the `symphainy_source` root directory, moved here on December 5, 2024 for better organization.

## Organization

All files have been moved from:
- **Source:** `/home/founders/demoversion/symphainy_source/*.md`
- **Destination:** `/home/founders/demoversion/symphainy_source/docs/12-5-archive/`

## Files Moved

See `MOVED_FILES_LIST.md` for a complete list of all 66 files that were moved.

## Files Kept in Root

- `README.md` - Intentionally kept in root as the main project README

## Purpose

These files represent:
- Historical documentation
- Fix summaries and root cause analyses
- Architecture analysis documents
- Implementation status reports
- Testing results and summaries
- Cleanup and optimization reports

## Access

All files are preserved with their original content. They can be:
- Read directly from this directory
- Referenced in documentation
- Restored to root if needed (though not recommended)

## Script

A Python script was created to automate this move:
- Location: `scripts/move_root_md_files.py`
- Can be used for future cleanup operations
