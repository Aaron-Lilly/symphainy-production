# Visualization Dependencies (Vega/Altair)

The following packages are required for rendering Vega-Lite/Altair visualizations in the frontend:

- `react-vega@^7.6.0`
- `vega@^6.1.2`
- `vega-lite@^6.1.0`
- `vega-embed@^6.29.0`

**Note:** These versions are required for compatibility with `react-vega` 7.x and Vega-Lite 6.x visualizations generated by the backend. Using other versions may result in peer dependency conflicts or rendering errors.
